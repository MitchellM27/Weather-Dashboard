# Weather-Dashboard

## Task: Creating a day scheduler that dynamically changes and adjusts to user inputs.
* Goal: To create a dynamic webpage that allows a user to view the weather conditions in a city. They will be able to search a city of their choice and view the current weather. The forecast for the next 5 days will also be available.
* Specifications: The webpage must use the open weather server side api to extract data and utilize it in a responsive user interface. Previous searches that the user looked up will appear below the search bar. The forecast will appear with dynamic icons indicating what type of weather conditions can be anticipated.
* Points of Emphasis: This project will specifically exhibit newly attained skills in javascript and HTML that allows the use of external server side apis to aquire data, then the ability to utilize it in a useful user interface. 
* Completion: This project is completed when fully functioning HTML, CSS, javascript and READ.ME files are pushed and submitted into a github repository. Then the Link is shown here: https://mitchellm27.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
